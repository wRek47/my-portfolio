Never a moment (The Same Thing)

In the plan for the day, there's never a moment to wait.
But in the shadow of the moment, there's never a time or a place.
And then again, when I feel like it begins to all fall down
I can't help, but to find, myself in a time. Where I'll make. my. way.

I spend so much time living, being told too little to late.
I spend my time by my rules, being told it's all fucked up.
I can't help but to find, myself without a ground, I'm flying.

And still I make my way, throughout the day and night.
And still I make my way, through all the streets and the headlights.
You will not help but to find, that you're just like me, it's frightening.

But because of that, I love you even more.
I'll mention how I met you, to the world next door.
When you are feeling low, I make you soar.

We love the same thing, we feel the same way, we make our own way.
I love it even more.
Again the same thing, we felt the same way, we changed our own ways.
What's different from before?

Not good or bad, it's new and still the same.
I love it even more.
When there's never a moment to wait.
